# Yugioh-stuff
This is where my Yugioh project lives

This is a project that i'm working on that allows a user to use a Shiny app to look up various stats about Yu-gi-oh cards.
For example, how the stat total (Attack + defense) of Dark Effect Monsters have changed over time.

Currently fairly limited, but hopefully will be more useful as time goes on.

The theme is mostly for fun. Might try and add an option to switch it to something less extreme.
